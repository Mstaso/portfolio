        "description" : "Course Matcher helps coding bootcamp students, like myself, find a job after graduating.  The idea behind the app is for a user to match with a business by taking the courses a business has flagged.  Once one or more of the courses are complete, the user can then match with the business and gain a match percentage based on how many courses the user completed.  I used the Coursera API to generate 1,000 instances of courses and created filters for category and subcategory.",
